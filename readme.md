Learning web development on odin projectr website has been an interesting journey.
wow! although i'm still at an introduction stage, i can say boldly that i've gained 
 alot. starting from the use of virtual box to use another OS on the same machine, 
ability to now use git and github even though it's basic, it means a lot to me. Then 
HTML and CSS, another awesome web tools, i Have improved in this aspects too. This 
is just to mention but few things. I'm excited to learn more.
